        <h3 id="quote"><i>Everyone has the ability to increase resilience to stress. It requires hard work and dedication, but over time, you can equip yourself to handle whatever life throws your way without adverse effects to your health. Training your brain to manage stress won't just affect the quality of your life, but perhaps even the length of it. Amy Morin</i></h3>

        Hello I am William, better known by my online aliases as Creeperwillie and risko789. I am a prospective computer science major who is certified in Python, Javascript, and is currently learning SQL and Java. Other than computer science I have a deep rooted fascination for the natural sciences, especially paleontology and physics alongside an appreciation for history focusing on 20th century and Cold War European developments. I am proud to announce that one of my longest projects is finally reaching its deserved attention, my Mincraft Addon Ancient Aquatic about prehistoric life inside of the Pierre Shale inside of the central United States.      </p>
