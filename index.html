        <h3><i>Everyone has the ability to increase resilience to stress. It requires hard work and dedication, but over time, you can equip yourself to handle whatever life throws your way without adverse effects to your health. Training your brain to manage stress won't just affect the quality of your life, but perhaps even the length of it. Amy Morin</i></h3>

        Hello I am William, a coder and one who's intense curiosity in academic studies led me here, to Foundations of Programing Class. In my free time, I usually work on completing my Minecraft mod among other intermitent intellectual projects.
