        Hello I am William, a coder and one who's intense curiosity in academic studies led me here, to Foundations of Programing Class. In my free time, I usually work on completing my Minecraft mods along with other intermitent intellectual projects. This class has developed my knowledge and understanding of coding, most specifically so far, HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the code language that makes up website's structure. In other words, html writes the text, images, links, tables, lists and other cruicial parts of the website. CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is the language that helps bring a website to life using colors and other decorative aspects. Below is an example of most of these aspects in action, including lists, links, and tables
